title: Use bpftrace for debugging - An example
tags: [BPF]
---

# Introduction
[*bpftrace*](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) is a high-level tracing
language for Linux enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF). I found it very
useful for debugging issues as well as understanding kernel code. In this post,
I will use one example to demonstrate how I used *bpftrace* for debugging.

# Example - Unexpected DSCP modification
In one test, I found packets coming out of one process were marked with DSCP 18
unexpectedly. I needed to identify the culprit and *bpftrace* helped a lot.

## Who sets DSCP?
There are at least two possibilities:
1. A BPF program attached to egress TC hookpoint modifies DSCP.
2. The process itself calls
   [`setsockop`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/setsockopt) to set DSCP.

I ruled out (1) by running command `tc filter show dev eth0 egress` to confirm
there was no egress TC BPF programs. To confirm (2), I used bpftrace to check
if there is any call to `setsockop` in the process. The following command
means, "Trace all setsockopt syscalls in process 131204 and print the callerâ€™s
thread name and tid".

```
# bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_setsockopt /pid == 131204/ { printf("%s (tid %d)\n", comm, tid); }'
```

{: .box-note}
**Note**: `comm`, `pid` and `tid` are [builtin
variables](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace#builtins). Though bpftrace
README says `comm` is the process name, it is in fact the thread name.

Output of above tracing command confirmed that there were indeed `setsockopt`
calls from this process. And all of them came from certain network-related
library. This partially confirmed hypothesis (2). We still con't be 100% sure
because `setsockopt` can be used to set various options other than DSCP.

## More evidence
To obtain more evidence, we need to confirm that `setsockopt` was called to set
DSCP instead of other options. So let's do a more detailed tracing:
```
# cat setsockopt.bt
tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_setsockopt
/pid==$1/
{
  @fd = args->fd;
  @level = args->level;
  @optname = args->optname;
  @optval = *args->optval;
  @optlen = args->optlen;
  if (@optname == 67) {
    printf("pid: %d, fd:%ld, level:'%ld', optname:%ld, val:%ld, len:%ld\n",
            pid, @fd, @level, @optname, @optval, @optlen);
    printf("%s\n", ustack());
  }
}
```
Here, instead of using a one-liner to trace callers, I wrote a more complex
tracing script, which prints all parameters as well as user stack trace when
`setsockopt` is called with optname parameter being 67
([IPV6_TCLASS](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/in6.h#L257)). 

When running *bpftrace* with this tracing script, I got something like

```
# bpftrace setsockopt.bt 131204
Attaching 1 probe...
pid: 131204, fd:26629, level:'41', optname:67, val:72, len:4

```

The val parameter has value 72. If we look at Traffic Class field in IPv6
header, 72 actually means DSCP 18 (`18 << 2 == 72`)!

**Note:** Unfortunately, the user stack printed by *bpftrace* only showed addresses but
not symbols (See [this issue](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/issues/246)).
I had to attach gdb to the process to print the symbols.
```
# gdb -p 131204
(gdb) info symbol 0x7f46b035b2ea
...
```

After this tedious job (`info symbol <addr>` address by address), I eventually
identified the stack trace in the library that sets DSCP.
