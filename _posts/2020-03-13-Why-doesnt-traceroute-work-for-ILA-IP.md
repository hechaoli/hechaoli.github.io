title: Why doesn't traceroute work for ILA IP?
tags: [ILA, Network]
---

# Summary
Our project uses [Identifier-Locator Addressing (ILA) for
IPv6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-herbert-nvo3-ila-04). Recently, we
noticed that *traceroute* doesn't work well for SIR address. The problem is,
though *traceroute* can reach ILA router and eventualy reach the ILA host, all
the intermediate nodes between the ILA router and the ILA host are shown as "\*
\* \*". This post is about the debugging process of the issue, the root cause
and a potential fix.

# Background

## ILA
ILA is a virtual networking solution. It assigns a unique 64-bit identifier to
each task in the data center. This identifier is location-independent and is
tied to the task. When another task wants to communicate with an ILA-task, it
sends packets with destination IPv6 address being 64-bit SIR (Standard
Identifier Representation) prefix + 64-bit identifier.

An ILA router in the network translates this virtual IP (SIR address) into a
physical IP (ILA address) and forwards packets to the physical host where the
destination task runs. With ILA, no matter where the task moves to, its IPv6
address (SIR address) is never changed.

See [*Identifier-locator addressing for
IPv6*](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-herbert-nvo3-ila-04) for more
information.

## Traceroute

This is covered by [*traceroute* man
page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/traceroute) and I will just copy it here.

>This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow  to some
>internet  host by launching probe packets with a small ttl (time to live) then
>listening for an ICMP "time exceeded" reply from a gateway. We start our
>probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an ICMP "port
>unreachable" (or TCP reset), which means  we  got to  the "host", or hit a max
>(which defaults to 30 hops). 

**Note, by default, traceroute on Linux uses UDP for probe packets.**

# Problem
While using *traceroute* to trace ILA packets, we found that **intermediate
hops between ILA router and the final destination are unknown (printed as
"\*").**

The output is something like:
```
$ traceroute6 <ILA task> -N 1 -q 1
traceroute to <ILA task> (<ILA task SIR address>), 30 hops max, 80 byte packets
 1  <Top-of-Rack switch> (ToR IP)  0.224 ms
 2  <hop 2> (<hop 2 IP>)  0.303 ms
 3  <hop 3> (<hop 3 IP>)  0.303 ms
 4  <hop 4> (<hop 4 IP>)  0.226 ms
 5  <hop 5> (<hop 5 IP>)  0.272 ms
 6  <hop 6> (<hop 6 IP>)  4.692 ms
 7  <hop 7> (<hop 7 IP>)  0.263 ms
 8  <hop 8> (<hop 8 IP>)  0.279 ms
 9  <hop 9> (<hop 8 IP>)  0.437 ms

23  *
24  *
25  *
26  <ILA task> (<ILA task SIR address>)  53.374 ms
```

# Debug
## Setup
To reproduce and debug the issue, I set up a minimal environment with one ILA
router, one ILA task and one *traceroute* host (TR host). They are all under
the same rack.  So an ILA packet's route should be "TR host --> ToR --> ILA
router host --> ToR --> ILA task host".

![Traceroute debug setup](/assets/img/traceroute_debug_setup.png)

When *traceroute* the SIR address, I got
```
<TR host>$ traceroute <SIR address>
traceroute to <SIR address> (<SIR address>), 30 hops max, 80 byte packets
 1  <ToR> (<ToR IP>)  0.214 ms  0.258 ms  0.325 ms
 2  <ILA router> (<ILA router IP>)  0.080 ms  0.096 ms  0.071 ms
 3  * * *
 4  <ILA task> (<SIR address>)  0.179 ms  0.182 ms  0.171 ms
```

As we can see, the third hop, Top-of-rack switch, is missing from the output.

## Wait, mtr works?

It was almost the end of the day and I really missed home so I didn't spend
much time debugging. Somehow I just decided to give
[*mtr*](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mtr) a shot and guess what?  It worked!

```

```

The third hop, ToR, was printed as expected. So our solution was just using
*mtr* instead of *traceroute*. 

## But WHY?
Even though we found an alternative, this annoying *traceroute* problem haunted
me in my dream. The last scene before I woke up was endless *tcpdump* output,
driving me to continue debugging.

I had some guesses and all I needed to do was to (dis)prove them.

## Guess #1 - ICMPv6 Time Exceeded is not sent back by ToR

This is unlikely because otherwise *mtr* should also fail but I needed more
evidence.

I ran *tcpdump* on all 4 nodes while running *traceroute*. The result disproved
this theory. All UDP probe packets were sent and received as well as all ICMPv6
Time Exceeded packets. Below is the pcap file:

![pcap of traceroute](/assets/img/traceroute_pcap.png)

## Guess #2 - *traceroute* uses UDP while mtr uses ICMP Echo

Because *mtr* works but *traceroute* doesn't, it became a game of finding the
difference between them.

We mentioned earlier that *traceroute* uses UDP as probe packets. Look at pcap
result, it seems that *mtr* uses ICMP Echo (ping) as the default protocol.

![pcap of mtr](/assets/img/mtr_pcap.png)

Unfortunately, this is still not the reason because *mtr* with UDP (`mtr <IP>
--udp`) also works and the pcap result looks very similar to that of
*traceroute*.

## Guess #3 - *mtr* uses UDP port to match probe/response while *traceroute* doesn't

I then looked more closely into the packets in *Wireshark*. One interesting thing
I noticed was, *Wireshark* pairs a UDP probe with its ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
response when any of them is focused.

![Wireshark pairs UDP probe with ICMPv6 Time Exceeded response](/assets/img/wireshark_pair.png)

When I click the 3rd UDP probe, even **Wireshark didn’t pair it with the ICMPv6
Time Exceeded response from the ToR**. This made me wonder - how does Wireshark
do the matching and could it be the same way as *traceroute*?

At this point, I had a strong feeling that the answer must reside in these UDP
and ICMPv6 packets. I just needed to examine each and every bit. And here comes
the next interesting finding - **the ICMPv6 reply has an inner IP and UDP
header**.


![Content of ICMPv6 reply](/assets/img/icmpv6_reply.png)

It seems that the ICMPv6 response embedded the original IP and UDP content as
its body in order for sender to match it with the original request. Then I
realized that it might because ***mtr* only uses inner UDP port to associate
ICMPv6 response with UDP probe yet *traceroute* as well as Wireshark uses
src/dst IPs in the inner IP header + UDP port**. 

The first half of the theory was easily proved by reading *mtr* code.

As the name implies,
[handle_inner_udp_packet](https://github.com/traviscross/mtr/blob/9fed81ee89665ef860e3e22713ea80720986e701/packet/deconstruct_unix.c#L64)
is called to handle inner UDP packet. It calls
[find_probe](https://github.com/traviscross/mtr/blob/b402c6dc6dba64b9eae46e0029403845090fcb34/packet/probe.c#L176)
to match this UDP with an outstanding probe. And It **first tries to find a
match with `dstport` and then `srcport` and then `checksum`**. Any information
in the inner IP header is not used. Nice! This puzzle is 50% solved.

Next, I only needed to read some [*traceroute
code*](https://sourceforge.net/projects/traceroute/files/traceroute/traceroute-2.0.22/)
and confirm that it uses inner IP for the matching (Thankfully, both tools are
open-sourced). Simple task, huh? Well, the reality always lets us down. After
spending some time going through *traceroute* code, I still couldn’t find such
logic. [This
line](https://github.com/pevik/traceroute/blob/a77c4139b81b70cfc4a1c8f44b5a576d052ae02a/traceroute/mod-udp.c#L174)
suggested that **it also only uses UDP port to do the matching**. And I was
pretty sure the version of the code I looked at was the same as the version of
*traceroute* run.

Because I was too lazy to continue reading the code, I started using *gdb* to
trace the code. After some tedious debugging with *gdb*, I finally got something. 

[Here](https://github.com/pevik/traceroute/blob/a77c4139b81b70cfc4a1c8f44b5a576d052ae02a/traceroute/poll.c#L73),
`poll` function is called to determine whether a response is received. If its
return value is larger than 0, then
[recvmsg](https://github.com/pevik/traceroute/blob/a77c4139b81b70cfc4a1c8f44b5a576d052ae02a/traceroute/traceroute.c#L1316)
will be called to receive actual data. However, **the breakpoint at recvmsg was
hit only 3 times and it wasn’t hit when the Time Exceeded message from ToR was
received**. That means, `poll` didn’t detect the message on the socket. This
also implies that **the inner IP matching might be done in the kernel**, who
decides not to send the packet to the socket. 

But why does kernel only do this to *traceroute* but not *mtr*???

## Guess #4 traceroute does something irritating and kernel hates it

With above findings in mind, I came back to the game of finding the difference
between *mtr* and *traceroute* code. That was when I noticed [this
line](https://github.com/pevik/traceroute/blob/a77c4139b81b70cfc4a1c8f44b5a576d052ae02a/traceroute/mod-udp.c#L137)
\- **`udp_send_probe` calls `connect` syscall on the UDP socket**. This looked
very strange to me. As we all know, UDP is a connectionless protocol. Why does
it even need to call `connect`?

According to [`connect` syscall man
page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html),

> The connect() system call connects the socket referred to by the file
> descriptor sockfd to the address specified by addr.

AND

> Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may successfully connect() only
> once; connectionless protocol sockets may use connect() multiple times to
> change their association.

That means, a connectionless protocol like UDP can also call `connect()` to
associate the socket with an address. And ***traceroute* calls it to associate the
UDP socket with destination address, which is the SIR address**. Thus, when the
response has an ILA address in its inner IP header, it is not sent to the socket! (I
didn’t read specific kernel code here. I’d appreciate it if anyone can point me
to relevant code.)

Now the puzzle is fully solved!

# How to make *traceroute* work?
Knowing the root cause, the fix is rather easy. I have a simple patch:
```

```

After rebuilding *traceroute*, it works well for SIR address now:

```
$ make
$ ./traceroute/traceroute <ILA task SIR address> -N 1 -q 1
traceroute to <ILA task SIR address> (<ILA task SIR address>), 30 hops max, 80 byte packets
<... Unrelated hops ...>

24  <ToR> (<ToR IP>)  163.857 ms
25  <ILA task> (<ILA task SIR address>)  163.132 ms
```

However, I would guess that this is a "feature" instead of a "bug" because
otherwise why did the genius author of *traceroute* choose to call
`connect()` on a UDP socket? I just don't understand the reason behind it.
