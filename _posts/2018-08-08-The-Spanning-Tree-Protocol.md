# Overview
We talked about what is a bridge (switch) and how it works
[here](/2017/12/13/linux-bridge-part1/) and [here](/2017/11/23/vxlan/).
However, we only saw the topology in which one bridge is used to merge LANs. In
real life, redundancy is always necessary in order to provide high availability.
For example, instead of using only one link between two bridges, we can use two
links so that the traffic won't be affected even if one of them goes down. But
this configuration also creates a loop in the topology which can severely
affects the network. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to make any
topology loop-free. In this article, we will see how loops in a topology can be
harmful and how STP solves the problem.

# Problems of Loops in a Topology

## Broadcast Storm
Suppose we have the following topology where two links exist between two
bridges.

![Bridge Loop Topology](/assets/img/bridge-loop-topology.png)

Obviously, there is a loop between two bridges. When Host A sends out a broadcast
packet, what will happen is:

1. The broadcast packet sent out by Host A is received by Bridge A port 2.
2. Since this is a broadcast packet, Bridge A will forward it to port 0 and port
   1.
3. The broadcast packet is received by Bridge B port 0 and port 1. Port 0 will
   forward it to port 1 and port 2. Port 1 will forward it to port 0 and port 2.
4. The broadcast packet is received by Host B (twice), Bridge A port 0 and
   Bridge A port 1. Bridge A port 0 will forward it to port 1 and port 2. Bridge
   A port 1 will forward it to port 0 and port 2.
5. The broadcast packet is received by Host A (twice), Bridge B port 0 and
   Bridge port 1. Now we go back to step 2 again!

This is the so-called broadcast storm - the broadcast packets will keep flooding
the network till the loop breaks or the bridge crashes.

### Experiment

We can see the storm by doing an experiment with Linux bridge. To set up above
topology, run the following command:

```bash
$ sudo brctl addbr bridgeA
$ sudo brctl addbr bridgeB
$ sudo ip link add portA_0 type veth peer name portB_0
$ sudo ip link add portA_1 type veth peer name portB_1
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeA portA_0
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeA portA_1
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeB portB_0
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeB portB_0
$ sudo ifconfig bridgeA up
$ sudo ifconfig bridgeB up
$ sudo ifconfig portA_0 up
$ sudo ifconfig portB_0 up
```

Above commands will create two bridges and two links ([veth
devices](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html)) between them. Note,
we only enable one link `portA_0 - portB_0` between two bridges for
now.

#### Step 1
Launch two VMs using KVM. Let's call them Host A and Host B. They
are connected two bridge A and B respectively. Run the following command to
confirm:

```bash
$ brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
bridgeA         8000.52c2cb8b5685       no              portA_0
                                                        portA_1
                                                        vnet0
bridgeB         8000.4ab4cee1ab35       no              portB_0
                                                        portB_1
                                                        vnet1
```

#### Step 2
On Host A, run the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1/24
```

On Host B, run the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2/24
```

After this step, Host A and Host B should be able to ping each other.

#### Step 3
Run tcpdump on Host B:
```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v icmp
```

On Host A, ping a broadcast address:
```bash
$ sudo ping -c 1 -b 192.168.1.255
```

On Host B, we will see one ICMP packet captured.

![Before Broadcast Storm](/assets/img/before-broadcast-storm.png)

#### Step 4
Then we enable the second link between bridge A and B:
```bash
$ sudo ifconfig portA_1 up
$ sudo ifconfig portB_1 up
```
Repeat Step 3. This time we should be able to see a broadcast storm on
Host B:

![Broadcast Storm](/assets/img/broadcast-storm.png)

The storm will keep flooding your screen until you break one link by:
```bash
$ sudo ifconfig portA_1 down
```

## Mac Address Learning Confusion
Due to the broadcast storm, the bridge will also be confused by the MAC
addresses. Specifically, when the first time Bridge A port 2 receives a packet
from Host A, it adds one entry `Host A MAC - port 2` to its MAC table. However,
later, due to the loop, the same broadcast packet is received by Bridge A port
0, causing Bridge A to update existing entry to `Host A MAC - port 0`. Then the
same broadcast packet is received by Bridge A port 1, making existing entry be
updated again. So on and so forth. The bridge will keep updating the MAC table,
which is also a problem.

# Spanning Tree Protocol
In above experiment, when we saw a broadcast storm, we stopped it by manually
breaking one link in the loop. Rather than doing this, if we just enable STP on
the bridges, the loop can also be **logically** broken.

To enable STP:
```bash
$ sudo brctl stp bridgeA on
$ sudo brctl stp bridgeB on
```
Add back the second link:
```bash
$ sudo ifconfig portA_1 up
$ sudo ifconfig portB_1 up
```
If now we repeat Step 4 above, we won't see previous storm any more even with
two links between bridges.

The way that STP makes the topology **logically** loop-free is by putting
certain ports into blocking state. When there are configuration changes or
bridge/link failures, STP can also detect the changes and update the topology
accordingly. We will see how it works in the following sections. Only the basic
idea and high level overview will be covered. For more detailed information, see
[RFC 7727](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7727).

## Terminology

### Bridge Roles
There are two bridge roles: root bridge and designated bridge.

* **Root Bridge**<br>
As the name implies, Spanning Tree Protocol generates a logical **tree** (which
is by definition loop-free) from a topology. Thus, there must be a root in the
tree. We call a bridge a "root bridge" if it is the root of the spanning
tree.

* **Designated Bridge**<br>
While each tree has only one root bridge, there is one designated bridge for
each LAN, which becomes the bridge all hosts and bridges on the LAN use to reach
the root. [1]

### Port Roles
There two port roles: root port and designated port.

* **Root Port**<br>
The port with the lowest path cost to the root bridge.

* **Designated Port**<br>
The port with the lowest path cost to the root bridge **on each LAN**.

### Port States
Each port can be in any of the following states:

* **Disabled**<br>
The port is shutdown through administrative action. In previous experiment,
after running command `ifconfig portA_1 down`, the port is disabled.

* **Blocking**<br>
The port is up but it doesn't forward any traffic. In other words, it is
logically shutdown.

* **Listening**<br>
The port is not forwarding traffic and not learning MAC addresses. This is a
transient state between blocking and learning.

* **Learning**<br>
The port is not forwarding traffic but is learning MAC addresses. This is a
transient state between listening and forwarding.

* **Forwarding**<br>
The port is receiving and sending traffic as normal.

### Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)
BPDUs are protocol frames used to exchange information among bridges. There are
two types of BPDUs:

* **Configuration BPDU**<br>
Used to define a loop-free topology. One important component of a configuration
BPDU is *priority vector*, consisting of Root Bridge ID, Root Path Cost, Bridge
ID, and Port ID. I will refer it as `[BR-Root, Cost, BR-ID, Port-ID]`. We will
see how it is used later. For now, we only need to know that smaller vector has
higher priority. For example, [1, 0, 1, 0] has higher priority than [2, 0, 2, 0]
and [1, 0, 1, 1] has higher priority than [1, 0, 1, 2].

* **Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU**<br>
Used by a bridge to notify the root bridge about a detected topology change. I
will not cover the topology change part in this article.

## Algorithm Overview
The distributed STP algorithm consists the following steps:
1. Select a root bridge and put all its ports into forwarding state.
2. Each bridge selects a root port.
3. Each LAN selects a designated port.
4. Put all other ports into blocking state.

### Root Bridge Selection
Initially, all bridges think itself is a root bridge. Thus, each of them start
transmitting a BPDU with Root Bridge ID to be its own ID and Root Path Cost to
be 0. Eventually, the bridge with the smallest Bridge-ID will become the root
bridge. Bridge-ID format is as follows:

![Bridge ID](/assets/img/stp-bridge-id.png)

(Image Credit [1])

That means, if all bridges have the same priority, then the one with the
smallest MAC address will win. However, if the administrator wants to configure
a specific bridge as the root bridge, he just needs to make its bridge priority
smaller than others.

### Root Port Selection
After selecting a global root bridge, other bridges must select their own root
port, which is the port with the shortest path to the root bridge. Note, the
root bridge doesn't have a root port while non-root bridges have one and only
one root port.

Similar to selecting a root bridge, the selection of root port is also done by
comparing priority vectors. On a bridge, if all ports have the same cost to root
bridge, then the port with the smallest Port-ID will be selected as root port.
For example, in the topology above, suppose Bridge A is the root bridge, then
both port 0 and port 1 on Bridge B have the same cost to root bridge. In this
case, port 0 becomes the root port because it has a smaller port ID.

### Designated Port Selection
Each bridge is usually on more than one LAN, so it must learn the designated port
for each LAN. As mentioned before, the designated port should be the one that
has the shortest path to the root bridge and there is exactly one designated
port per LAN.

Thus, for all ports on a LAN, the one with the shortest path to root bridge is
selected as the designated port. If two port has the same cost, again, the one
with a smaller priority vector will win.

### Block All Other Ports
All ports other than root port and designated port will be put into blocking
state.

## Example & Experiment

### Topology
We use the following topology as an example:

![STP Example Topology](/assets/img/stp-example-topology.png)

First let's add three bridges:

```bash
$ sudo brctl addbr bridgeA
$ sudo brctl stp bridgeA on
$ sudo ifconfig bridgeA hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:0A up
$
$ sudo brctl addbr bridgeB
$ sudo brctl stp bridgeB on
$ sudo ifconfig bridgeB hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:0B up
$
$ sudo brctl addbr bridgeC
$ sudo brctl stp bridgeC on
$ sudo ifconfig bridgeC hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:0C up
```

### Root Bridge Selection
Now, let's add the first link: `portA_0 - portB_0`
```bash
$ sudo ip link add portA_0 type veth peer name portB_0
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeA portA_0
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeB portB_0
$ sudo ifconfig portA_0 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:A0 up
$ sudo ifconfig portB_0 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:B0 up
```

![Root Selection Topology 1](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-topo-1.png)

After we enable both ports, we will see BPDUs exchanged by bridge A and B.

* Both bridges send a BPDU with their own Bridge-ID as Root Bridge ID.

![Root Selection 1](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-1.png)

![Root Selection 2](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-2.png)

* Bridge A and B agree that A is the root because it has a smaller priority
vector (smaller Bridge-ID). After this agreement is reached, only Bridge A
will send BPDUs.

![Root Selection 3](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-3.png)

Current bridge and port info:

![Root Selection 4](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-4.png)


Next we add one more link `portB_1 - portC_1`.

```bash
$ sudo ip link add portB_1 type veth peer name portC_1
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeB portB_1
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeC portC_1
$ sudo ifconfig portB_1 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:B1 up
$ sudo ifconfig portC_1 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:C1 up
```
![Root Selection Topology 2](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-topo-2.png)

After Bridge C is connected to Bridge B through `portC_1`, it first thinks
itself is the root bridge and sends a configuration BPDU with its own Bridge-ID
as the Root Bridge ID.

![Root Selection 5](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-5.png)

Then after it receives a BPDU from Bridge B, saying that the root bridge is A,
Bridge C will agree on that and stop sending BPDUs.

![Root Selection 6](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-6.png)

Bridge C's info:

![Root Selection 7](/assets/img/stp-example-root-selection-7.png)

### Root Port Selection

Now we add link `portA_1 - portC_0`. After that, there will be a loop in this
topology. In theory, this time `portC_0` should become the new root port of
Bridge C because it is closer to root bridge A (cost 2) comparing to `portC_1`
(cost 4).

```bash
$ sudo ip link add portA_1 type veth peer name portC_0
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeA portA_1
$ sudo brctl addif bridgeC portC_0
$ sudo ifconfig portA_1 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:A1 up
$ sudo ifconfig portC_0 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:C0 up
```

![Root Port Selection Topology 1](/assets/img/stp-example-root-port-selection-topo-1.png)

Let's see what happens after adding this link.

Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDUs will be sent first. But I will skip
this part and only focus on how it reaches a loop-free topology.

![Topology Change](/assets/img/stp-example-topology-change.png)

Bridge C `portC_0` should receive BPDUs with Root Path Cost 0 sent by Bridge A
`portA_1` and calculate the cost of `portC_0` to root bridge A, which is `0
(Root Path Cost in BPDU) + 2 (port cost) = 2`. Since its cost to root bridge is
less than `portC_1`, `portC_0` now becomes the root port. This can be verified
looking into the bridge info:

![Root Port Selection 1](/assets/img/stp-example-root-port-selection-1.png)

The root port of Bridge B stays unchanged and it is still `portB_0`.

![Root Port Selection 2](/assets/img/stp-example-root-port-selection-2.png)

### Designated Port Selection

There are 3 LANs in the topology: link `portA_0 - portB_0`, link `portA_1 -
portC_0` and link `portB_1 - portC1`. For the first two LANs, the designated
ports are no doubt `portA_0` and `portA_1` because they are the ports of root
bridge. For LAN `portB_1 - portC1`, they need to select a designated port. As we
can see, both ports have same cost to root bridge. But since Bridge B has a
smaller Bridge-ID, `portB_1` becomes the designated port.

![Designated Port Selection 1](/assets/img/stp-example-designated-port-selection-1.png)

### Block All Other Ports

`portC_1` is not selected as the designated port in LAN `portB_1 - portC_1`, nor
is it the root port of Bridge C. Thus, it is put into blocking state.

![Block All Other Ports](/assets/img/stp-example-block-other-ports.png)

Now the topology is loop-free. Logically, it looks like:

![Logical Topology](/assets/img/stp-example-logical-topology.png)

If we shut down `portB_0`, then STP will detect the topology change and
re-enable `portC_1`. I will leave this experiment to the reader.
