# Basic Approaches
* Check logs and see if any error messages/exceptions there.
* Check system status - CPU, memory, disk, network, etc. See if any abnormal patterns exist.

# Useful Commands
## Display Processes

```bash
$ ps aux # BSD syntax
$ ps -ef # Standard syntax
$ ps aux --sort=-pcpu | head -5 # Display the top 5 processes consuming most of the cpu. "-" symbol means descending
order.
$ ps aux --sort=-pmem | head -5 # Display the top 5 processes consuming most of the memory.
```

## Top
```bash
$ top # Show stats of all processes
$ top -p <pid> # Show stats of specific process
```

## Network
```bash
$ netstat -nlpt # List listening (-l) tcp (-t) sockets and show numerical addresses (-n) as well as print process ID
(-p)
$ netstat -anpt # List both listening and non-listening sockets (-a)
$ lsof -i # List all connections
$ lsof -i:8080 # List all processes that use port 8080
$ lsof -i -sTCP:LISTEN # List all listening files
$ lsof -i -sTCP:ESTABLISH # List all established fiels
```

## Disk
```bash
$ df -h # Show the space on all currently mounted file systems in human-readable format
$ du -h -s . # Summarize disk usage of current directory. Same as du -h -d 0 .
$ du -h -d 1 . # Summarize disk usage of current directory, depth is 1
$ iotop # Need to be installed
$ iostat # Need to be installed
```

## Jps
```bash
$ jps -l # List all java processes
$ jps -lv # List all java processes in verbose mode
```

## Java Thread Dump
```bash
$ jstack -l <pid> > threaddumps.log # JDK must be installed in order to run this command
```
Java Thread States:
* NEW: A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
* RUNNABLE: A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.
* BLOCKED: A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state.
* WAITING: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state.
* TIMED\_WAITING: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is
  in this state.
* TERMINATED: A thread that has exited is in this state.

## Java Heap Dump
```bash
$ jmap -heap <pid> # Dump the heap
$ jmap -histo <pid> # Dump instances and size
$ jmap -dump:format=b,file=heapdump.hprof <pid> # Dump the heap in hprof format so that we can use Yourkit to analyze
```

## Java Native Memory Tracking
Supported since Java 8. It can be used to track internal memory usage for a HotSpot JVM.

# Useful Tools
## Yourkit Java Profiler
[https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/features]()

### Remote Profiling Setup
Official Guide: [https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/remote_profiling.jsp]()

To sumarize, there are two ways to remote profile an application. One is using Yourkit's [console version of Java EE
server integration wizard](https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/profiling_j2ee_remote.jsp), which is foolproof. The other way is to enable profiling manually by starting JVM with
additional options. See [https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/agent.jsp](). The option is in format `-agentpath:<full agent library
path>[=<option>, ...]`. For full set of options, see [startup_options](https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/startup_options.jsp)

### Port Forwarding
If the application can only be accessed from a jump host, which can be accessed by our own laptop, then we need to have
port forwarding on both the machine that runs the application and the jump host. For example, if the topology is:
![Jump Host Topo](/assets/img/jump-host-topo.jpg)

Then you need to do the following steps:
First, run the following command on application machine:
```bash
$ ssh -R <agent_port>:localhost:<agent_port> <jumphost_user>@<jumphost_ip>
```
This command will forward any connection to \<agent\_port\> on application machine to the same port on jump host.
Second, run the following command on jump host:
```bash
$ ssh -R <agent_port>:localhost:<agent_port> <laptop_user>@<laptop_ip>
```
Agent port is the port you set in the profiler startup option. For example,
`-agentpath:/home/libyjpagent.so=listen=0.0.0.0:12345`. Then the agent\_port is 12345. Open YourKit GUI on the laptop and
click "Connect to remote application...".  Input "localhost:12345" and click "connect".

### YourKit CLI
This is useful when there is no UI available.
Run the tool with the following command:
```bash
$ java -jar <Profiler Installation Directory>/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar <options>
$ java -jar <Profiler Installation Directory>/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar # Get list of available options
$ java -jar yjp-controller-api-redist.jar localhost 12345 start-cpu-tracing # Enable CPU profiling
$ java -jar yjp-controller-api-redist.jar localhost 12345 start-alloc-recording-all # Enable memory profiling
$ java -jar yjp-controller-api-redist.jar localhost 12345 capture-performance-snapshot # Capture performance snapshot
```

## JProfiler (TODO)
[https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html]()

Similar to Yourkit. But I have no experience.

## JVisualVm
This is a Java Virtual Machine Monitoring, Troubleshooting, and Profiling Tool provided by JDK. I have no experience
and I am not sure if it is as good as YourKit or JProfiler. But this is a free tool.
See [jvisualvm](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/jvisualvm.html)
